# Working with resources on statically-typed programming language

In *statically-typed* programming language, *compile* is required to make executable program.
Nowadays, practically compiling is usually carried out through *build* process because it sometimes requires fetching depenencies or a certain converting.
Statically-typed programming is better than dynamically-typed programming language at the point that various errors in your program would be detected by compilers' *type system*.
